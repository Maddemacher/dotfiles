%\cvitem{Abstract}{This thesis explores the possibility of the functional programming paradigm in the domain of hard embedded real-time systems. The implementation consists of re-implementing an already developed system that is written with the imperative and object oriented paradigms. The functional implementation of the system in question is compared with the original implementation and a study of code complexity, timing properties, CPU utilization and memory usage is performed. The implementation of this thesis consists of re-developing three of the periodic tasks of the original system and the whole development process is facilitated with the TDD development cycle. The programming language used in this thesis is C but with a functional approach to the problem. The conclusions of this thesis is that the functional implementation will give a more stable, reliable and readable system but some code volume, memory usage and CPU utilization overhead is present. The main benefit of using the functional paradigm in this type of system is the ability of using the TDD development cycle. The main con of this type of implementation is that it relies heavily on garbage collection due to the enforcement of data immutability. We find in conclusion that one can only use the functional paradigm if one has an over dimensioned system when it comes to hardware, mainly when it comes to memory size and CPU power. When developing small systems with scarce resources one should choose another paradigm.}

%Dear Sir or Madam
%
%My name is Emil and I saw on LinkedIn that you are currently searching for a Software Engineer for your eye tracking applications with surrounding GUI.
%
%As I am a creative person with a great interest for problem solving, I think that this might be a good position for me. I have a masters degree in Applied Computer Science and I have always had a great interest in learning new things. That is one of the main reasons to why I chose Software Engineering as my profession; you never run out of new things to learn. Personal development is very important for me and I am sure that myGaze can facilitate this need.
%
%I am currently employed at a Swedish company as a Software engineer. I started out as a Junior Software Engineer but quickly advanced to a normal Software Engineer. Here I have been working on everything from low level control systems up to an Angular Js based front end. With that in mind, one could say that I am truly full stack. The business layer I am currently working on is a micro service based architecture with Rx (Reactive Extensions) at heart that communicates with its underlying layer via a REST api and the overlying layer through Rabbit MQ.
%
%In my free time I enjoy physical activities such as power lifting, Olympic lifting and bouldering. Due to my active lifestyle I have the ability to handle pressure and stress in a constructive manner.
%
%With my education, my experience and my lifestyle I believe that I would be a perfect fit for this position.
%
%Thank you for taking the time to consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.
%
%Sincerely yours 
%Emil Bergström
